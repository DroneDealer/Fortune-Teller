# Fortune Teller
Upon interacting with the crystal ball, the player will find new threads of fate waiting to be woven... 
Fortune Teller is a Unity-based game that delivers ridiculous responses to your most mystical inquiries!

## Inspiration
I wanted to learn how to create visually engaging games, and I thought: what better way to do that than with a bit of magic? So I made a couple of magic-themed projects, including Fortune Teller, to experiment with aesthetic design, playful interactions, and magic - inspired UI.

## Gameplay
- Press the spacebar to advance through dialogue lines
- Upon the dialogue ending, the camera will zoom to the crystal ball - it may take a second to load in the next part!
- There are 9 buttons with various types of fortunes on them (luck, studies, love, etc.) Choose the one you would like to hear about and voila!
- You can consult the crystal ball as many times as you'd like - just keep in mind that its answers are finiteâ€¦ for now.
  
## Features
- **Typewriter style dialogue**
- **Beautiful graphics and art**
- **Over 90 fortunes** to receive
- **Future plans** include integration of AI rather than a finite list of answers
